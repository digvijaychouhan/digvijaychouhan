# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @digvijaychouhan
I'm transitioning into Infrastructure Automation and DevOps, with a focus on Ansible, Linux, and OpenShift. I love using open-source tools to turn manual tasks into reliable, repeatable workflows. I am also enthusiastic about visualization tools such as Grafana and Kibana, and open-source security tools such as Wazuh. I'm looking to collaborate on any of the above topics or security operations implementation.

ðŸ”§ Skills in Progress:
- Ansible, Terraform
- Linux & Shell Scripting
- GitHub Actions
- OpenShift (Developer Sandbox)
